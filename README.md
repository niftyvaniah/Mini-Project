# Book Rental System
## Martinez, Ryan James J. and Macalisang, Nifty Vaniah L.  
Renting can open the readerâ€™s mind and they say with a good book you can never be lonely. However, books are costly so renting would always be a better option. This Book Rental System would let the user manage the books being borrowed by the borrowers. It would keep track of the information of both the books and borrowers. It would also manage the information of both parties.
